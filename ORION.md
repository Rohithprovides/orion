# Orion Programming Language

## What is Orion?

Orion is a **pure compiled systems programming language** designed to bridge the gap between C's raw performance and Python's readable syntax. It's a modern language that compiles directly to native machine code, providing the speed of low-level languages while maintaining the elegance and simplicity that makes code easy to write and understand.

## Core Philosophy

Orion was built on the principle that **performance shouldn't come at the cost of readability**. Too often, developers must choose between writing fast code or writing clear code. Orion eliminates this trade-off by providing:

- **C-level performance** through direct machine code compilation
- **Python-like readability** with clean, intuitive syntax
- **Automatic type detection** - no explicit type declarations needed
- **Safety features** that prevent common programming errors

## Why Orion Was Built

### The Problem
Modern software development faces a fundamental challenge:
- **High-level languages** (Python, JavaScript) are easy to write but slow to execute
- **Low-level languages** (C, C++, Rust) are fast but complex and error-prone
- **Existing compiled languages** often sacrifice readability for performance or require verbose type annotations

### The Solution
Orion addresses these issues by:
1. **Compiling to native code** for maximum performance
2. **Using familiar syntax** that developers already know
3. **Automatic type detection** - write code without type declarations
4. **Enabling rapid prototyping** with immediate feedback via web interface

## Implementation Technologies

### Core Compiler (C++)
- **Lexical Analysis**: Custom tokenizer for Orion syntax
- **Parser**: Recursive descent parser generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- **Type Checker**: Static type analysis with automatic inference
- **Code Generator**: Direct x86-64 assembly generation
- **Runtime**: Minimal C runtime for essential operations

### Web Interface (Python/Flask)
- **Backend**: Flask web server for compilation requests
- **Frontend**: Modern JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 and Prism.js
- **Real-time Compilation**: Instant feedback and error reporting
- **Interactive Input**: Support for programs requiring user input

### Development Tools
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Web-Based IDE**: No installation required, runs in browser
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Custom Orion language support
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed compilation and runtime error messages

## Language Features

### 🔢 **Automatic Type Detection**
```orion
# All variables use automatic type detection
age = 25          # Detected as int
pi = 3.14159      # Detected as float  
name = "Orion"    # Detected as string
is_ready = true   # Detected as bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # Detected as list
```

### 🔧 **Variable Management**
```orion
# Simple assignment with automatic type detection
a = 5
message = "Hello"

# Constants (with automatic type detection)
const PI = 3.14159
const MAX_SIZE = 1000

# Scope control
global total_count
local temp_value

# Chain assignment
x = y = z = 0
```

### 🧮 **Comprehensive Operators**
```orion
# Arithmetic
result = a + b - c * d / e % f
power = base ** exponent
floor_div = numerator // denominator

# Compound assignment
counter += 1
balance -= fee
score *= multiplier
```

### 🔄 **Control Flow**
```orion
# Conditional statements
if score > 90 {
    grade = "A"
} elif score > 80 {
    grade = "B" 
} else {
    grade = "C"
}

# Loops
while condition {
    process_data()
}

for i = 0; i < count; i++ {
    out(i)
}

for item in collection {
    handle(item)
}

# Loop control
break      # Exit loop
continue   # Skip to next iteration
pass       # Do nothing (placeholder)
```

### 🔧 **Functions (No Type Annotations)**
```orion
# Block syntax - no type annotations needed
fn calculate_area(width, height) {
    return width * height
}

# Single expression syntax  
fn square(x) => x * x

# Function calls
area = calculate_area(10, 20)
result = square(5)

# Main function (entry point)
fn main() {
    out("Hello, World!")
}
```

### 📚 **Data Structures**
```orion
# Lists (automatic type detection)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, true]

# List operations
length = len(numbers)
append(numbers, 6)
last = pop(numbers)

# Indexing (including negative)
first = numbers[0]
last = numbers[-1]
numbers[1] = 42

# Tuple assignment
(x, y) = get_coordinates()
(first, second) = swap(a, b)
```

### 💻 **Built-in Functions**
```orion
# Input/Output
out("Hello, World!")
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Type utilities
type_info = dtype(variable)
text = str(number)

# List utilities
size = len(my_list)
append(my_list, item)
removed = pop(my_list)
```

### 🧱 **Advanced Features**
```orion
# Structs (with automatic type detection)
struct Point {
    x
    y
}

# Enums
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green, 
    Blue
}

# String interpolation
greeting = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# Comments use # syntax
# This is a single-line comment
# Multiple lines require multiple # symbols
```
